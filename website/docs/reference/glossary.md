# Glossary of Physical AI Terms

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Physical AI Book.

## A

### Actuator
A component of a robot or physical AI system that converts control signals into physical action, such as moving a robotic arm or adjusting a valve.

## C

### Control System
A system that manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems in a physical AI context.

## E

### Embodied AI
A branch of artificial intelligence that emphasizes the role of an agent's physical form and its interaction with the environment in developing intelligence.

## L

### Learning (in Physical AI)
The process by which physical AI systems adapt their behavior based on experience and environmental feedback.

## P

### Perception
The component of Physical AI that processes sensory data from the environment to understand the state of the world.

### Physical AI
The integration of artificial intelligence techniques with physical systems, enabling machines to interact with and understand the real world through sensors, actuators, and control systems.

### Planning
The component of Physical AI that determines what actions to take to achieve specified goals, based on the perceived state of the world.

## R

### Robot Operating System (ROS)
A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions for creating robot applications.

## S

### Simulation-based Development
An approach to developing Physical AI systems that involves testing algorithms and systems in virtual environments before deploying them in the real world.
