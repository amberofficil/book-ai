# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Vision

To create an accessible, comprehensive guide that demystifies Physical AI for beginners and intermediate learners, providing hands-on experience with real-world applications of AI in physical systems, robotics, and embodied intelligence.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
All concepts must be grounded in practical, interactive examples that readers can implement themselves. Theory is only valuable when paired with tangible application. Every chapter includes executable code samples and suggested experiments that demonstrate Physical AI concepts in action.

### II. Beginner-to-Intermediate Accessibility
Content must be approachable for beginners while offering sufficient depth for intermediate learners. Complex topics are broken down into digestible concepts with clear prerequisites stated. Mathematical concepts are explained intuitively before formal notation is introduced.

### III. Docusaurus Documentation Excellence
All book content follows Docusaurus best practices for documentation. Content is structured with clear navigation, proper cross-linking, and responsive design. Code examples are syntax-highlighted and tested for accuracy. Accessibility standards are met to ensure broad usability.

### IV. Embodied Learning Approach
Physical AI concepts are taught through examples that connect AI algorithms with physical systems. Every major concept includes real-world robotics or physical simulation examples that demonstrate how AI operates in embodied environments rather than purely digital ones.

### V. Iterative Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Content development follows an iterative approach: Core concept → Simple example → Advanced application → Reader challenges. Each section is tested with target audience readers before publication to ensure comprehension and engagement.

### VI. Technology Integration Focus
Focus areas requiring special attention: Integration between simulation and real-world robotics, Hardware abstraction layers, Performance considerations for real-time systems, Safety protocols for physical AI implementations.

## Success Criteria

- 90% of beginner readers can successfully execute core code examples after reading
- Content receives positive feedback from target audience in pre-publication testing
- Book successfully guides readers from basic understanding to implementing simple Physical AI projects
- Docusaurus implementation meets accessibility standards and loads quickly
- All code examples are verified to run correctly in specified environments

## Stakeholders

- Primary: Beginners and intermediate learners in Physical AI and robotics
- Secondary: Educators teaching Physical AI courses, Researchers seeking practical implementations
- Contributors: Technical writers, Subject matter experts, Beta readers from target audience
- Maintainers: Development team responsible for content updates and technical infrastructure

## Brand Voice

Authoritative yet approachable, encouraging experimentation and curiosity. The tone is supportive, recognizing that Physical AI can be challenging, while maintaining technical accuracy. We emphasize safety in physical AI implementations and promote responsible AI development practices.

## Governance

This Constitution governs all development of the Physical AI book project. All content, code examples, and documentation must align with these principles. Amendments require explicit documentation of changes, approval from core maintainers, and a migration plan for existing content if needed. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles before merging.
