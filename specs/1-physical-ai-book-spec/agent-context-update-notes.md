# Agent Context Update

The following command would update the agent-specific context file:

`.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType qwen`

This script would:
- Detect that Qwen is the AI agent in use
- Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
- Add only new technology from the current plan
- Preserve manual additions between markers

Since this script doesn't exist in the current environment, this step is noted but cannot be executed.
